Compilation instruction
-----------------------

Assuming main.cpp to be the source file that uses SWORD, the following commands will 
compile and link it.

  g++ -o main.o -c main.cpp -I$SWORDPATH/include/
  g++ -o main main.o $SWORDPATH/lib/libsword.a 

An example Makefile is contained in doc/Makefile.
